Then I converted the product in the for loop to a str and applied the reverse function. Then I checked whether or not the product string and its reverse were equal, if they were, I would append the product integer to a list called prod_list and used the max method to find the largest number in the list.

If it is case sensitive, nothing else is done to the string and its processed as is. If it is case insensitive, then we have the option of converting the string to all lower case at the start of the function. Next the function does a case sensitive comparison of consecutive characters while keeping track of the count, and when a different charater is encountered, the string is compressed and the counter is reset. Once the end of the string is reached as indicated by index i, reaching the end count of the lenght of the string, the returned string is updated one final time."
